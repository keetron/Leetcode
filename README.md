# Leetcode
My code challenges for Leetcode

The point of this repo is to have a non-local repository managed by version control.
If you read this, you are either trying to check my skills as a developer or trying to find a solution to some code challenge you encountered on the web.

To anyone actually reading this, if you email me your POBox or equivalent, I will send you a self draw postcard as a reward for reading readme files.
